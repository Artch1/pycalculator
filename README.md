Things to consider:
1. The software code and documentation are all in portuguese, as this is a personal project.
2. The software in it's basic state is essentially done, some features were planned to being added (as it can be seeing in the software itself) but as the code served its learning purpose, as of April 2019, will no longer be updated.
3. The code hasn't been updated since 28 May, 2017.
4. There aren't any software-breaking bugs known to date.
